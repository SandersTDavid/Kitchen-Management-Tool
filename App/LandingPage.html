        <h2>Why use iCanPrep</h2>
         <p2>
             This website provides useful tools to help new or inexperienced chefs to get to know their section in the kitchen.
             <br>
             <br>The <b>first tool</b> on the components page allows the chef to take out all the different components in the section and to indivdually add them to a list along with a method of preparation and the amount of time it should take to prepare.
             <br>
             <br>The <b>second tool</b> on the preparation list page allows the chef to quickly add an item to a daily preplist and swap the order of it. This helps the chef think about the best order that the list could go in to get the most amount of work done.
             It will also display the total preparation time.
